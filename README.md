# ecore-glsp
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonny3576/ecore-glsp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eclipsesource/ecore-glsp)

Ecore GLSP provides a web-based editor for Ecore Models (including Diagrams), integrated with Eclipse Theia. It contains two components: one [GLSP](https://github.com/eclipsesource/glsp) language server (Server-side, written in Java), and one GLSP client extension to actually present the diagrams (Using [Sprotty](https://github.com/eclipse/sprotty-theia)). 

Ecore GLSP can display an existing Ecore model. The diagram layout will be persisted in an .enotation file next to the .ecore file. The diagram editor also supports creation of new elements (EClasses, EAttributes, EReferences...), as well as partial support for editing existing elements (Renaming, deleting...).
